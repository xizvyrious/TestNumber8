		<h3> Spiritual Counselling </h3>

			<p> Many people often find themselves looking for something to uplift them after a long week of work,
				or an emotionally trying month in their personal lives. They just can't seem to connect with
				organized religion, but want somewhere to put their faith. <br />
				Allaina offers spiritual counselling, while working in a judgement-free zone. She has used
				spirituality to lift her out of fear, and personal darkness in a lack of self-confidence, into 
				a place of happiness and self-sufficiency.</p>

		<h3> Communicating with Loved Ones </h3>
		
			<p>Who knows you better than your loved ones? From early on, they always knew just what to say,
				or do, to help you. <br />
				Allaina offers the opportunity to communicate with those that have passed away through one
				of her sessions. She cannot guarantee that they will communicate, but far more often than
				not, she is successful in this transmission. The loved with will often validate themselves
				so that you know personally, where the advice is coming from.</p>

		<h3>Pet Communication</h3>

			<p>Allaina has found that she also has a special connection with animals. Fortunately,
				she is not limited to her pets alone, but has discovered that she is able to receive
				messages from other pets as well. This does not happen with every pet encounter,
				but happens quite often.</p>

		<h3>Advanced Spiritual Learning</h3> 

			<p>Similar to spiritual counselling, advanced spiritual learning is a service for individuals who
				may be encountering experience that they never have before. This can be terrifying for those
				who have no idea what is happening, and have no one to discuss the situation with. <br />
				In the world we live in, it can be exhausting trying to find someone who will listen,
				especially when the topic crosses into the spiritual realm. <br />
				Allaina is here to offer a home, free from judgement, where you can share and learn
				about your spiritual experiences.</p>

		<h3>Group Meditations </h3>

			<p>Allaina is currently in the process of acquiring a facility to hold group meditations.
				She both personally suggests, and professionaly requires that you start with Paula Perelman's 
				<a href="http://www.channelingheaven.com/meditation-journaling-classes-with-paula-perelman/"> 
				beginner and intermediate</a> classes before you begin hers.</p>

			<p>Because Allaina feels that she has been chosen to help people spiritually, she does not feel comfortable
				charging for her services. Because of this, please feel free to donate using the following link.
				Anything that you are able to give is greatly appreciated.</p>
